# Arabic N-gram Language Model for Sentence Generation

This project aims to develop an N-gram model that predicts the next word in a sentence based on the preceding words, utilizing a corpus of plain text. The model will handle n-grams with lengths ranging from 2 to 6. Users can specify the desired length of the generated sentence in terms of the number of words (tokens) and provide an initial word. The model will then generate a sentence with the specified number of words/tokens. The corpus used for this project is the KSUCCA Files corpus.
