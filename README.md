# Assignment1-NLP

This assignment involves building an N-gram model to predict the next word in a sentence based on the preceding words, using a corpus of plain text. The N-gram model will be built for n-grams of length 2 to 6, and the user will input the number of words (tokens) they want in the desired sentence and one initial word. The model will then generate a sentence with the desired number of words/tokens.

To complete this assignment, the student can use any NLP library in Python or Java and any Arabic plain corpus for any domain. As an example, the KSUCCA Files corpus can be used, which is available for download on SourceForge.

After building the N-gram model, the student should evaluate eight test samples by human expert (either themselves or a friend) to determine the accuracy and effectiveness of the model. The output of the model should be compared to what a human expert would expect the next word to be in each sentence.

Finally, the student should submit the code they used to build the N-gram model and the test samples, including the input and output for each test case. Additionally, they should provide a text file containing the ten most frequent trigrams in the corpus they used.
